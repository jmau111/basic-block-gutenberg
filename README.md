# Basic Block Gutenberg

Basic example made with the amazing package `@wordpress/scripts`.
Creating Gutenberg codes (blocks, sidebar, hooks) is a lot easier than before.

## Instructions

To get this basic block in your WordPress:

* Download and activate the plugin
* `cd YOUR_PATH/wp-content/plugins/basic-block-gutenberg` (replace `YOUR_PATH` with your path to the WordPress install)
* `yarn && yarn dev` 
* enjoy

## Use it as starter

It's a starter, nothing more, but it's the easiest structure. `src` and `build` folders are important.
The `@wordpress/scripts` package uses them, but the `build` folder is automatically generated when you run a `yarn build` or a `yarn dev`
